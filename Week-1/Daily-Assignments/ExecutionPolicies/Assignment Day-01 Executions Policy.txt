# What is PowerShell execution policy? 
 
-> PowerShell's execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.  
-> This feature helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts. -> The execution policy for a particular session is stored only in memory and is lost when the session is closed. 
 
# PowerShell execution policies: - 
 
1. All Signed: - -> scripts can run. 
-> requires that all scripts and configurations files be signed by a trusted publisher, including scripts that you write on the local computer. 
-> prompts you before running scripts from publishers that you haven't yet classified as trusted or untrusted. 
-> Risks running signed, but malicious, scripts. 
 
2. Bypass: - 
-> Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts 
 
3. Default: - 
-> Restricted for windows clients. 
-> Remote Signed for windows users. 
 
 
 
4. Remote Signed: - 
-> the default execution policy for windows server computers. 
-> scripts can run. 
-> Requires a digital signature from a trusted publisher on scripts and configuration files that are downloaded from the internet which includes email and instant messaging programs. 
-> Doesn't require digital signatures on scripts that are written on the local computer and not downloaded from the internet. 
 
 
5. Restricted: - 
-> the default execution policy for windows client computers. 
-> permits individual commands but does not allow scripts. -> prevents running of all script's files, including formatting and configurations and configurations files (.ps1xml), module script files (. psm1), and PowerShell profiles(.ps1). 
 
6. Undefined: - 
-> if the execution policy in all scopes is undefined, the effective policy is restricted for windows clients and remote signed for windows server. 
 
7. Unrestricted: - 
-> unsigned scripts can run. There is a risk of running malicious scripts. 
-> warns the user before running scripts and configuration files that are not from the local internet zone. 
 
 
# Execution policy scope: - 
a. Machine Policy 
b. User Policy 
c. Process 
d. Current User 
e. Local Machine 
 
-> using Remote-signed I will run the restricted script and change into the unrestricted 
Step 1:- please refer Assignment Day-01 Execution Policy.PDF 
Step 2: - we can open the PowerShell as a Run as administration because of the restricted script 
Step 3: -  
a. I will run the script on the administration policy by using 
    Command: - Set-Execution Policy - Execution Policy Remote Signed 
b. Then the script is asking for permission then we will proceed them and write YES/Y. 
c. then the script can run

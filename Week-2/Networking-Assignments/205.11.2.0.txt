Problem StateMent :- 

-> Subnet the Class C IP Address 205.11.2.0 so that you have 30 subnets:- 
-> What is the subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts?
-> How many hosts can each subnet have?
-> What is the IP address of host 3 on subnet 2? 

Solution :- 

step 1:- First We know we have 30 subnets :-
        ->  So, 2^5 = 32 , I need to borrow the 5 bits from class C bits 
        ->  so the address of class c is 255.255.255.0
        ->  after we borrow the bits the address subnet mask binary value is 
        ->  11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000 which is equal to in decimal 255.255.255.248

step 2:- Then we find the number of network :- 
        -> formula is 2^N (N == No of bits from you can borrowed )
        -> 2^5 = 32 , So the number of network is 32 

step 3:- Then we find the number of IP address :- 
        -> Formula :- 2^N (N == No of Host Bits)
        -> 2^3 = 8 Ip address , So the ip address is 8

step 4:- Then We find the number of hosts :- 
        -> Formula :- 2^N-2 (N== No bits remaning in host bits )
        -> 2^3-2 = 8-2 = 6 Host
        NOTE :- Here 2 , we have First bit or IPAddress in network is Network Id and last bit or ip address will be broadcast Id

Question :- 
Ques :- What is the subnet mask for the maximum number of hosts?
Solution :-  255.255.255.248  , Hosts is :- 6 

Ques :- How many hosts can each subnet have?
Solution :- 2^3-2 = 6 Host 

Ques :- What is the IP address of host 3 on subnet 2? 
Solution :- The IP address of host 3 on subnet 2 is 205.11.2.11, which is obtained by adding the subnet and host bits to the network bits: 11001101.00001011.00000010.00001011
        -> It have 32 Network that means i have 2^3 = 8 IPAddresses
        -> So that means 1 Address of top is networkID and last Address is boardcast Id
        -> So, range for Subnet 2 is from 205.11.2.9 to 205.11.2.14. 
        -> So, we have 6 host in network
        -> so, that means host3 on subnet 2 IPAddress is 205.11.2.11.

docker pull >> pull the images 
docker rmi >> remove the images 

docker run -d <image_name> >> for detached mode is background me run hojayega
docker ps -> containers listed
docker run <image_name> -> run the containers
docker start <container_name | id > -> start the container
docker stop <container_name | id > ->> stop the runnig container

Now, Create image of this container :-
docker commit <container_name> <image_name>
Now, create container from this image :-
docker run -it --name <new_name_of_this_container> <image_name>






docker stats -> is showing the running conatiner cpu,memory or process and networks I/O. 
docker system df  -> is showing the disk usages of docker
docker system prune -> remove unused data
-> dangling images are those who are not associated with the running conatiner
-> all stopped container
-> all networks not used by at least one container
-> all dangling images
-> all build cache


-> if build x error :- 
CMD:-  docker build -f <file_name> -t <image_name> .
